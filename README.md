# Software Engineer Challenge

In this challenge, you need to create a website crawler, given one URL, you need to crawl over the entire HTML code and follow any valid links to other pages you may find. And for each link you find, crawl those links as well. Then, all the links found must be shown somehow.

- You are free to choose any programming language.
- There is no need to create a graphical interface, for all I care, the results could be shown in a CLI app.

Bonus points if you do the following:

- Your code runs inside docker containers and everything runs smoothly using `docker-compose up`
  - More bonus points if you provide Kubernetes deployment files.
- Your app is hosted on a Cloud provider.
- The commits are properly documented and atomic.
